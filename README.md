# COVID-19 Tracker
Lockdown Android Project on COVID-19

COVID-19 Tracker is an Android App that shows you the "Global Stats", "India Stats", and also "All Other Countries Stats" related to COVID-19. I developed this app during the lockdown time using REST API and Volley Library on the Android Platform.
